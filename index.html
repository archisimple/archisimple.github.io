## ArchiSimple 

ArchiSimple is a computational model of root architecture. This model has been designed to enable the representation of the architectural diversity coming from various plant species interacting with various environmental conditions. In comparison to previous models, it is a new conceptual framework which assumes that most variations of developmental characteristics of the roots can be summarized by the size of their tip. Thus, two robust and important relationships are included: elongation rate versus root tip diameter; diameter of lateral roots versus diameter of their mother roots. These relationships allow representing the distribution and dynamics of root diameters. The model parameters are concrete, and can be estimated independently from data coming either from specific experiments or from the literature.
